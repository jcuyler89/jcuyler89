- ⚡ Fun fact:  Did you know that the term "bug" in programming actually has a real-world origin? The first actual computer "bug" was a moth found trapped in the Mark II computer at Harvard University in 1947. Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found the moth and taped it to the logbook, coining the term "debugging" to mean fixing computer glitches².
